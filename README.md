# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-with-Pyspark-ML

Built a simple linear regression model using PySpark ML to predict studentsâ€™ chances of university admission. Using the Graduate Admission 2 dataset from Kaggle, I performed data cleaning, preparation, and model building entirely in the Google Colab environment. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with setting up PySpark, working with DataFrames, and applying machine learning techniques in a distributed computing environment.
